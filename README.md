## Getting Started with Development

### Project Plan: Test Automation with AI Tools

1. **Define the Scope**  
    Determine the aspects of software testing you want to automate (e.g., UI testing, API testing, performance testing).

2. **Choose AI Tools**  
    Consider AI-powered testing tools like Selenium (with AI enhancements), Test.ai, Applitools, or Mabl.

3. **Set Up the Environment**  
    Ensure you have the necessary framework, dependencies, and cloud testing infrastructure.

4. **Develop AI-Driven Test Cases**  
    Leverage machine learning techniques to enhance test case generation and anomaly detection.

5. **Automate Execution**  
    Use AI-based tools to run automated tests, analyze results, and optimize test coverage.

6. **Evaluate Performance**  
    Measure effectiveness using metrics such as defect detection rates and execution time improvements.

7. **Publish & Share**  
    Document your findings, create tutorials, and share insights with the community (GitHub, Medium, or Kaggle).
